## General Guidelines

- Use Next.js 14 + TypeScript (with App Router for modern architecture)
- Use TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI for highly customizable, elegant components
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- Use Lucide Icons for clean and minimalistic icons
- Ensure fully responsive design (Mobile-first, grid-based layouts)
- Support Dark mode with seamless toggling
- Maintain consistent typography (use Inter, Poppins, or system fonts)
- Use proper spacing, padding, and contrast for better readability
- Implement fluid animations, hover effects, and dynamic interactions

## Code Structure & Best Practices

- Follow ShadCN UI component guidelines for consistency
- Keep code modular, reusable, and easily maintainable
- Use server components for optimized performance
- Ensure accessibility (a11y) and keyboard navigation support
- Implement global theme configurations for easy customization

## Styling & Design Principles

- Minimalist and professional look (Apple-like aesthetics)
- Card-based layouts for dashboards and data-heavy pages
- Soft shadows, rounded corners (2xl), subtle gradients
- Avoid excessive colors—stick to neutral tones with a primary accent
- Use ShadCN themes to maintain a cohesive UI

## Essential UI Components (ShadCN Focused)

### Dashboard Layout
- Sidebar: Expandable, includes icons and labels (ShadCN Sheet or NavigationMenu)
- Navbar: Contains search bar, profile dropdown, notifications
- Main Content: Dynamic grid layout, responsive card-based sections
- Widgets: Sales insights, revenue trends, quick actions

### Authentication Pages
- Login & Signup Forms: Clean UI using Card, Input, Button
- Magic Link / OAuth Support: Use Dialog for seamless authentication
- Password Reset Page: Well-structured with email validation

### Forms & Inputs
- Validated Input Fields (Input, Label, Textarea, Checkbox, Select)
- Dynamic Form Handling (Use useForm + zod validation)
- Multi-Step Forms (Stepper UI with progress indicator)

### Tables & Lists
- Paginated Tables (Table, DataTable with sorting and filtering)
- Collapsible List Items (Accordion for expandable content)
- Inline Editing (EditableTable for quick data updates)

### Cards & Widgets
- Stat Cards (KPI metrics with Card, Badge, and Tooltip)
- Recent Activity (List items with timestamps & avatars)
- Interactive Charts (Using recharts or visx)

## Advanced UI Features

- Neumorphism-inspired components subtly integrated
- Real-time updates via WebSockets or polling
- ShadCN DropdownMenu, Popover, and Tooltip for UX improvements
- Theme toggle using useTheme for light/dark switching

## Code Refinement Process

After generating the initial UI, refine it by:
- Enhancing contrast, spacing, and responsiveness
- Optimizing performance (lazy loading & server components)
- Adding elegant hover effects and animations
- Implementing consistent design patterns and global styles
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and a11y compliance
